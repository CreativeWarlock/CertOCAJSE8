         * Inheritence:
         * ------------
         * - is a mechanism allowing one type to acquire (or inherit) fields and methods from another
         * - the inherited type is called subtype
         * - the type whose members are inherited is called supertype
         *
         * Benefits:
         * ---------
         * + Inheritance allows members of a supertype to be reused in all its subtypes
         * + Subtypes may declare their own fields and methods (not accessible/visible within supertypes)
         *
